But I&amp;rsquo;m also open for a good and respectful discussion or to meet other people with similar interests.</description></item><item><title>Who am I?</title><link>https://zerotask.github.io/posts/1-who-am-i/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>hintermayer.patrick@gmail.com (Patrick Hintermayer)</author><guid>https://zerotask.github.io/posts/1-who-am-i/</guid><description>My name is Patrick Hintermayer and in the context of computer science I call myself Zerotask, that&amp;rsquo;s why the blog is called &amp;ldquo;From Zero to Task&amp;rdquo;. This name has no special meaning though. This name is based on zero day exploits which describe software or hardware vulnerabilities before the vendor is aware of. This means there is a timespan where hackers can abuse this vulnerability.
I am 29 years old and from Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany.</description></item></channel></rss>
