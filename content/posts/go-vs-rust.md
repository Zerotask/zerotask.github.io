I really like C#, but it often feels so bloated. Even for very little things, Visual Studio will create a bunch of files and you have to write so much code.
Of course some of this is because of the fact that it's a object oriented programming language but in comparison to JavaScript / TypeScript it feels sometimes unnecessary complex for me.
That was the reason I started to look for an alternative. This doesn't mean I want to quit with C#, I still like it and I look forward for the upcoming .NET 6.0 release and the changes
Microsoft announced, e. g. MAUI. But I want to be open for something new.

At first I came up with the Go programming language by Google and from time to time I also heard more and more of Rust. So I decided to start learning the syntax and ecosystem
of both languages and create a real life application for my company to have a good comparison. It's just a small tool to automate a project initialization, nothing fancy.
