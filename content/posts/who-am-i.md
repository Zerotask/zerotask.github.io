My name is Patrick Hintermayer and in the context of computer science I call myself Zerotask, that's why the blog is called "From Zero to Task".
This name has no special meaning though. This name is based on [zero day exploits](https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/what-is-a-zero-day-exploit.html)
which describe software or hardware vulnerabilities before the vendor is aware of.
I am 29 years old and from Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany. In the past I worked as a software developer and since 2021 I follow the path of an IT Consultant.
My favorite series are The King of Queens, The Big Bang Theory and Star Trek and I really like to play World of Warcraft (WoW).

I started with software development or to be more specific with web development at the age of 15. Back then I played the browser game called `Ogame` which is a space strategy / simulation game.
I had so much fun playing that relatively simple game, hang out with friends and conquer the universe. Then I found out about a project which was very similar to that game, some would say it was a clone.
This was the first open source project I contributed to. I began with little modifications, hosted my own game and my path to become a software developer has started.

Now, 14 years later I can look back to many years of programming and I don't regret it. :)
Coding is so much fun. You are able to create something special out of an idea, help yourself or others or just hang out and discuss with people which has similar interests like you.

My focus is still on web development, but I switched from PHP, which was my first language, to C# and JavaScript / TypeScript. Currently I'm also looking into Go and Rust.
