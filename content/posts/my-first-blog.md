Since I'm a very chatty person and I like to talk about such things, mostly about software development, I decided to create a blog and write down my thoughts
and maybe some of my posts will help others on their journey. But I'm also open for a good discussion or to meet other people with similar interests.

There are plenty of solutions to start with a blog, but since I'm a software developer and I've never done something with a static site generator, I decided to dig into
this topic, get an overview of tools and do a short comparison
