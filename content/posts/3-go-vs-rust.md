I really like C#, but it often feels so bloated. Even for very little things, Visual Studio will create a bunch of files and you have to write so much code.
Of course some of this is because of the fact that it's a object oriented programming language but in comparison to JavaScript / TypeScript it feels sometimes unnecessary complex for me.
That was the reason I started to look for an alternative. This doesn't mean I want to quit with C#, I still like it and I look forward for the upcoming .NET 6.0 release and the changes
Microsoft announced, e. g. MAUI. But I want to be open for something new.

At first I came up with the Go programming language by Google and from time to time I also heard more and more of Rust. So I decided to start learning the syntax and ecosystem
of both languages and create a real life application for my company to have a good comparison. It's just a small tool to automate a project initialization, nothing fancy.


## Introduction of Go (golang)
[Go](https://golang.org/) or sometime called golang describes itself as "an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software".
It was introduced in 2009 by Google and the first stable release was in 2012. The current version of Go is **1.16.13**

## Introduction of Rust
Rust describes itself as "A language empowering everyoneto build reliable and efficient software". It is a system programming language introduced in 2010 by Mozilla. Since February 2021
it has it's own foundation called [Rust Foundation](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/) which the founding members AWS, Huawei, Google, Microsoft and Mozilla.

## Comparison
Both languages are designed and used for different cases, therefore a comparison doesn't make much sense for some people, but there are also many use cases where both programming languages can do the job.
In short you can say that Go offers a faster development speed and Rust offers a faster runtime speed.

## Conclusion
